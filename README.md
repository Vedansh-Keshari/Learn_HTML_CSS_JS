# Learn_HTML_CSS_JS <br>
Learning web development <br>
Created a Web Development Documentation with separate connecting links to the HTML, CSS and JavaScript doc files.
Worked on HTML doc file for few days and created a complete roadmap with explanation as to what all a person needs to know for starting to write HTML scripts.
While writing the HTML doc file I came across few of the tags that had pretty common and easy usage so I did not consider keeping those in the explanation list.
I have not done a complete explanation of 100% HTML, but I can confidently say that I have written about most the tags there.
The explanation includes defintion, example, code, and respective output for each of the tags.
